# Random color generator app

The application should: display the text "Hey there" in the middle of the screen and after tapping
anywhere on the screen, a background color should be changed to a randomly generated color (should
be able to generate tel:16777216 colors using RGB).

Rules:
- Do not use any external libraries for color generation
- Use solid_lints to (https://pub.dev/packages/solid_lints) perform static code analysis and fix any
  issues.
